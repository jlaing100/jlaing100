My name is Jonah, and I am a Computer Engineering Student at SDSU! 
I am passionate about learning, and I view it as the ultimate source of both humility and fulfillment.
Artificial Intelligence captivates me. Designing programs more effective at solving tasks than us 
helps us come to terms with our mortality, and assists to clarify how we understand our own problem-solving
capacities and
how we as humans experience life.
